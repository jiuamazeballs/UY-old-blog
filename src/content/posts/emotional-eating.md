## Emotional Eating: Why healing isn’t in your fridge

Let's be real—sometimes the fridge is a therapist. Crappy day? Chocolate. Lonely night? Ice cream. Stress bomb? Chips, cookies, and a dash of guilt. But here's the truth: healing isn't residing in your fridge, and emotional eating isn't about food—it's about feelings.

### Why we eat our emotions

Emotional eating is the act of using food as a crutch, not because we're hungry, but because we're uncomfortable. Food becomes a way to comfort, distract, or anesthetize away what we don't want to feel.
Common triggers of emotional eating:
* Stress: Work deadlines, financial pressures, or relationship issues.
* Loneliness: Quiet ache when you feel alone.
* Boredom: Life is boring and food is exciting.
* Anxiety or sadness: When feelings are too much to handle.

Food is a quick solution. But as duct tape on a leaky pipe, it does not work long-term.


### The Vicious Cycle

### Repurcussions: Short-term? You might feel relief. Long-term? Emotional eating can lead to:• Weight loss or gain
* Stomach problems
* Sleep disruptions
* Fatigue
* Increased anxiety or depression
It's not calories—it's emotional residue.


### What Adlerian Psychology says about emotional eating

Let’s zoom out for a second. Emotional eating isn’t just about food—it’s about how we’ve learned to survive. And Adlerian Psychology, developed by Alfred Adler, gives us a powerful lens to understand that survival strategy.

Adler preached that every behavior is fulfilling a function, even the self-destructive behavior. Emotional eating? Not failure at all—it's an adaptive coping strategy grounded in our early experiences, beliefs, and sense of belonging.
The Four Phases of Adlerian Therapy (and how they apply to emotional eating)
Adlerian therapy unfolds in four phases: Engagement, Assessment, Insight, and Reorientation. Each of the phases assists in removing the layers of emotional eating and constructing healthier habits.


### Phase 1: Engagement – Building a safe space

Before healing can even start, there has to be trust. Adlerian therapists begin by establishing a working, respectful relationship. The therapist is not in charge—they're a partner. For someone struggling with emotional eating, this step is one of being heard, not judged.
Picture someone who’s spent years hiding their eating habits out of shame. In this stage, they're finally strong enough to declare, "I eat when I feel invisible." That's the process of change.


### Phase 2: Lifestyle assessment – Digging into the roots

That's where it gets really interesting. Adlerian counselors dig into a person's childhood memories, family relationships, where they were born, and how they were raised to discover the "private logic" for why they act the way they do.

Picture a person brought up by a neglectful parent. They might have learned that comfort isn't a request—it's something you find in private, like sneaking cookies from school. Maybe they were the oldest child, always held to this idea of being perfect. With food, they didn't have to be perfect.
These patterns form a lifestyle—a unique set of beliefs and coping strategies. And emotional eating often stems from mistaken beliefs like “I’m only lovable if I’m thin” or *I have to be in control to be safe.*

Interesting is the fact that Adlerian psychology (or "Individual Psychology") is notoriously future-directed, a focus on purpose and goals rather than causes in the past. As Adler says, behaviour is due to our desire for significance and belonging and not stifled by childhood trauma or unconscious drives as would be suggested by Freud.
But here is the catch: although Adler abandoned deterministic interpretations of the past, he did not abandon it completely. Rather, early memories, family constellation, and birth order are cornerstones of Adlerian counseling—not to wallow in the past, but to comprehend the individual's unique meaning from it. It is not what occurred, but what the individual attributed to them. That is where the difference lies.
So when Adlerian therapists ask a client about his or her early memories or ways of living, they're not excavating repressed trauma—they're discovering the inner logic that guides the person through life. It's a means of shedding light on false conclusions and redirecting them to healthier uses.


### Phase 3: Insight – Connecting the dots

Once the client and therapist are aware of the lifestyle, they begin to connect the dots. Why do we binge when we're depressed? Why do we feel so powerful when we restrict?
This is the phase of clarity without shame. It's where one may suddenly click, "I restrict food because I feel helpless in my relationships. It makes me feel powerful." That awareness isn't only eye-opening—it's liberating.


### Phase 4: Reorientation – Choosing a new path

This is the shift. Adlerian therapy enables the client to re-write history. Rather than responding out of old hurts, they are starting to make new, healthier choices.
This can manifest as:
* Being nice to oneself rather than being critical
* Calling a friend rather than ordering food
* Challenging the lie that thinness is worth


### Becoming mindful: Spotting the pattern

You have to know about it before you can shift emotional eating. That is where awareness tools are useful:
* BED Test, Anorexia Test, Bulimia Test: Try the online interactive quizzes on our website that can enable you to determine if your eating is part of a bigger problem.
* Mood Tracker: Track your mood each day. Pay attention to what emotions trigger cravings. Try our mood tracker tool
* Journal: Write it down. What happened before food reached your hands? How did you feel? What did you crave? If you are looking for an online journal you want to keep out of anyone's reach, you can also try our Dear Diary journal.



### Strategies to break the cycle

1. Mindful eating:
Slow down. Savor your food. Ask yourself: Am I hungry, or am I hurting?

2. Non-food coping mechanisms:
*	Call a friend
*	Take a walk
*	Listen to music
*	Write in your journal
*	Practice deep breathing

3. Distractions & hobbies:
Find joy outside the kitchen. Painting, gardening, dancing, puzzles—whatever gets you feeling alive.

4. Build a support system:
Healing happens when you build connection. Join a support group, see a therapist, or lean on good friends.

5. Hydration, sleep & movement:
* Water controls hunger and mood.
* Sleep balances emotions.
* Exercise dispels mental fogginess and releases endorphins.


### Final thought

Emotional eating isn't about not having willpower—it's unmet needs. When you begin fulfilling them with compassion, connection, and clarity, food is nourishment—not a numbing agent.
If you’re wondering whether your eating habits are emotional or something deeper, try the free BED, Anorexia, or Bulimia Tests on our website. Use the Mood Tracker and Dear Diary Journal to start your journey inward.
Because healing? It’s not in your fridge. It’s in you.
